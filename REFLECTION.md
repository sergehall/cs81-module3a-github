# Reflection

**What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?**  
In this assignment, I learned how Git serves as a version control system to help track changes in my code over time. I practiced using commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to move my local work into a remote repository hosted on GitHub. I also understood the importance of writing clear and descriptive commit messages to document what each change does. GitHub, as a platform, made it easy to view my commit history, access files from anywhere, and organize my work professionally. It was especially satisfying to see my code live on a public page, which gave me a sense of ownership and progress.

**What was most confusing or frustrating?**  
One of the most confusing parts was understanding the difference between the staging area and the working directory. At first, I didn’t grasp why files needed to be added (`git add`) before they could be committed. I also made a few mistakes when trying to push to GitHub — such as forgetting to set the main branch or not adding the remote URL correctly. Eventually, by reading the error messages and looking things up, I was able to fix these issues and build more confidence in the Git workflow.

**Why do you think developers use Git?**  
Developers use Git because it provides a safe, organized, and trackable way to manage code. With Git, you can experiment with changes without losing previous work, revert to earlier versions if something breaks, and collaborate with teammates without overwriting each other's files. Every meaningful change is recorded, which makes it easier to understand how a project evolves over time. In short, Git encourages discipline, clarity, and accountability in software development.

**How might this help with larger projects in the future?**  
On larger projects, Git becomes even more critical. As more people work on the same codebase, Git helps manage merges, conflicts, and concurrent updates. Branching allows developers to work independently on features or fixes without disrupting the main code. Having a detailed commit history also helps teams review changes, understand bugs, and maintain the system more effectively. For me as a student, learning Git now means I’ll be better prepared to contribute to team-based projects in future courses and in the professional world.
